# Readme plz
## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository. Or check it out and change the origin to your personal github repository.
2. To get started with latex checkout the generated pdf file in the root folder.  
3. After that add your configuration in `content_extra/properties`.
4. The root file is `bachelor_thesis_template.tex`. Get somewhat comfortable with how that one works.
5. Then you can start writing your content in the folder `content/`.

## Furter Reading
If you need more guidance on Latex (and trust me you will). The [Overleaf wiki pages](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) are pretty decent most of the time. Otherwise the [Wikibooks latex wiki](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is pretty useful as well.

## Questions?
If you have any questions feel free to ask me. But please have read the initial pdf first :P
